# Summary

Adds a series of Sartarite treasures, each with its own unique attributes! Currently there is no way of acquiring any of these treasures and installing this mod won't really get you anything, unless you want to spawn them in yourself.

# Treasures

Treasures are drawn from this list: http://kingofdragonpass.wikia.com/wiki/Treasure

## Box of Perpetual Flour

*A box of Perpetual Flour, which will help feed a clan in perpetuity. Provides enough flour to feed two people each year.*

A box which will slowly generate flour (which can be cooked into meals) when installed. When it generates a full stack of flour, it will spawn the stack on top of itself for hauling.

## Dragontooth Spear

*A spear carved from the tooth of a dragon. Our god-talkers said that it will help us pierce through defenses erected against us.*

A powerful spear which will instantly destroy any walls, furniture, or non-pawn items it strikes. Has no bonus against mechanoids, despite their inanimate nature.

## Ernalda's Oven

*An oven blessed by Ernalda, the Queen of the Earth. Bakes bread which remains warm for hours, using less grain than usual.*

An oven which can bake meals utilizing less vegetables than normal. Can also use the standard stove bills if desired.

## Humakt's Raven Banner

*A legendary treasure of the First Age. When carried into a fight, this battle standard guarantees victory in battle. However, it does so at great cost: the standard bearer is always killed.*

When equipped while enemies are nearby, buffs all other pawns with greatly increased armor, speed, and faster firing. When all enemies are dead or have fled, the standard bearer's life is claimed as payment.

## Kero Fin Ice
*A large chunk of bluish ice from the mother of Orlanth, Mount Kero Fin. It is very cold, and never melts.*

A more powerful passive cooler. Worth around two vanilla coolers and will cool down to 1 degree, allowing refrigeration of foods (though it's still not enough to freeze them).

# Acquiring Treasures

Treasures are sold by Sora Goodseller, a travelling trader-priest of Issaries. Sora's arrival incident has the same weight as a trade caravan. If she is killed, she'll stay dead, and any chances of further visits with new treasures will be spoiled.
